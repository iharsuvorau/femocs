Instructions to build the femocs library
----------------------------------------

* Specify the location of deal.II library in system by modifing the DEAL_II_DIR variable
  in femocs/release/CMakeLists.txt;

* Do the femocs build while being in a femocs/release/build directory:
mkdir build; cd build;

* If it's dirty from previous usage, clean it up:
rm * -r

* Build make files:
cmake ..

make

* As a result the static library libfemocs.a and fortran module file libfemocs.mod
  will be generated in directories femocs/lib and femocs/include, respectively.
